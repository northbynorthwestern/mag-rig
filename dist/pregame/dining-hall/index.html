        <p class="lead">Before starting college, you may have been dreading the prospect of eating bland dining hall food day after day. But then you arrived and realized the unlimited soft serve ice cream almost makes up for it. Soon enough, you’re happily slurping up ice cream after your main dish of french fries for every meal. You love it, but you regret it. As much time as you’ve spent building this love/hate relationship with the dining hall, it can still be a little messy. You’re in this romance for better or for worse, so here are a few tips on how to make it a long and loving one.</p>
        <div class="articlebody"></p>Don’t be afraid to mix ingredients from different dishes, and get crazy with it. Nutella makes everything better: toast, cookies, waffles. Maybe even french fries? Go for it. Add some crunch to your ice cream with sugary cereal or put some soft-serve in that stale coffee. Take advantage of seasonings and sauces and mix them in a bland dish. It’s a buffet for a reason!</p> </p>Remember that you can compost almost everything, so don’t throw anything away. Leave your napkins on your plate as you return your dirty dishes, and it will make it to the compost pile instead of the landfill.</p> &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src&#x3D;&quot;http://media.northbynorthwestern.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/11/29/dai_dininghall_4.png&quot;&gt; &lt;div class&#x3D;&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Photo by Ying Dai / North by Northwestern&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt; </p>Although the dining halls have their drawbacks, having access to an all-you-can-eat buffet for every meal is not one of them. But it’s also easy to walk away balancing six different dishes you don’t really need. Relax – it’s not your job to single-handedly clean out the dining hall. Northwestern’s Campus Kitchen gathers extra food from the dining halls and donates the meals to needy Evanston residents. Instead of taking too much and wasting food, start small and go back for seconds if you’re still hungry.</p> </p>If your friends are busy and you have to eat alone, there’s no need to be lonely. You have your reliable friend Netflix. Grab a corner table and your laptop and catch up on the latest episode of Scandal. You’ll look smart and studious to everyone else as you pig out to your favorite show.</p> </p>When all else fails, ask for grilled chicken.</p> &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src&#x3D;&quot;http://media.northbynorthwestern.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/11/29/dai_dininghall_5.png&quot;&gt; &lt;div class&#x3D;&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Photo by Ying Dai / North by Northwestern&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</div>
